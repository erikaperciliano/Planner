### 🔧 Back-end
The back-end of this project is built on Node.js, more specifically its LTS version.
You can install Node.js by following this guide: https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs

After installing Node.js, we will access the project's api folder, install the dependencies and then upload the HTTP server.
```
cd server

# Installing the dependencies
npm install

# Upload the HTTP server
npm run dev
```
### 📱 Mobile

To run the pass.in app we used Expo, an incredible tool from the React Native community. In addition to Expo, you must use a local emulator or a physical device to view the application.
You can install Expo and emulators by following this guide: https://react-native.rocketseat.dev/
```
cd mobile

# Installing the dependencies
npm install
```
After configuring the mobile environment, you can open the emulator and run the project according to the platform you are using:
```
npx expo start
```
